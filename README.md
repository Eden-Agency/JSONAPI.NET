# JSONAPI.NET
A .NET Library providing classes to easily implement JSON API standard (http://jsonapi.org) in a .NET Web API project.
## JSON API Specification
You can read all about the JSON API specification at the official website - [http://jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)
## Not quite ready...
Obviously this isn't ready to use yet. Once it is I'll create a 1.0 nuget package for the project, until then contributors are welcome.
